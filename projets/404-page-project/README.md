# 404 Page Project

This project is a simple web application designed to provide a fun 404 error page experience. Instead of a standard error message, users are greeted with a dice game interface where they can roll different types of dice.

## Files in the Project

- **index.html**: The main HTML page for the 404 error game. It includes a title, a message, a dice selection interface, and buttons for adding dice, rolling them, and clearing the results. It also links to a JavaScript file for functionality.

- **newpage.html**: A new webpage added to the project that contains additional content related to the game or project.

- **style.css**: The stylesheet for the project, which contains styles for the body, headings, buttons, and dice elements. It features a dark theme with colorful accents and uses the 'Press Start 2P' font for a retro gaming feel.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to access the 404 error game.
2. Select the type of dice you want to roll from the available options.
3. Use the buttons to add dice, roll them, or clear the results.
4. Navigate to `newpage.html` for additional content related to the project.

## Future Improvements

- Add more interactive features to the dice game.
- Include animations for rolling dice.
- Enhance the design with more visual elements and effects.
